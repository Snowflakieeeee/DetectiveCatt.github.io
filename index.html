        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>Religion and Spirituality are 2 really broad topics with something to know every time you open that bhagvat geeta, quran, bible, or whatever else you follow, Not only religious books but old texts from different civilizations form a different broad picture which is fun to learn about to me personally</p>
